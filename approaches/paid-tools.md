# Monetization via Paid Tools & Extensions
AKA: Loss Leader, Proprietary Update System

Payment for additional tools, update system, extensions, or plug-ins that help the users work with the OSS or extends the OSS functionality.
Can be one-time paymentments for one extension or tools, but recurring payments can be realized by app-stores.

Requires:
* Setup of a payment mechanism (hosted or self-build)
* Setup of a download mechanism (hosted or self-build)
* Development of one or many tools, extensions, or plug-ins

Variants & Options:
* Tool: Development of a tool helping in the use of the OSS (e.g., UI layout designer for a frontend framework such as react.js)
* Extensions & plug-ins: Additional functionality (similar to filters in photoshop, ...)
* Premium Replacement: Selling a second (closed-source) tool far better than the OSS

## Platforms
* [Apple's App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/) (Hosting Apps for MacOS and iOS)
* [Microsoft's App Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/windows) (Hosting Apps for Windows)

## Evaluation

| Characteristics                   | Value  | Note |
| --------------------------------- |:------ |:---- |
| Effort to set-up                  | High   | Requires development of additional software, hosting and payment
| Effort to maintain                | Medium | Only updates are required from time to time
| Cost to set-up                    | Medium | Will require a lawyer to setup the license and contracts
| Cost to maintain                  | Low    | Will cause costs for legal or tax related stuff (but should be covered by income)
| One-time Income                   | Medium | Tools can have higher price, extensions often have lower prices
| Recurring Income                  | Low    | Might be possible for tools with recurring payments
| Income Predictability             | Medium | Lower for Extensions but higher for recurring paments for tools
| Full income Threshold             | 100+   | 
| Recipient                         | C      | Might be only a sub-group who develop the tools, etc.
| Additional Work                   | High   | Extra work to develop and maintain tools, etc.
| Visibility                        | Medium | Tool will probably contribute to usefullness of OSS 
| Necessity to pay                  | Low    | Extensions often convenient but not necessary
| Entry Threshold                   | Low    | Credit card is sufficient
| Countervalue                      | Work   | Additional develoment effort necessary, but multiple sales possible
| Scalability                       | Low    | Scales with the number of users (who want the extension)
| Effort for marketing              | Medium | Extensions are often convenient and offer a countervalue
| Competitors                       | None   | Tools would have a proprietary license
| Software types                    | Special| Mostly Frameworks that have use for editors or products with an extension mechanism

> NOTE: If external developers create a similar tool or extension this could increase the competition
