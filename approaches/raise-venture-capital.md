# Monetization via Raising Venture Capital
AKA: Founding Startup

Getting funding to build a startup / company from the OSS using venture capital. Often a very good business case is required but can result in a stable income for the next years (even if the startup is not successful).

Requires:
* Willingness to create a business / company (by all involved maintainers and maybe contributors)
* Setup of a business plan/idea
* Fund-raising

Variants & Options:
* Bootstrapped: Building a Startup without VC money - requires a already working business model
* VC Funding: Getting money to build the company makes buildup easier - but founders will loose full control

## Platforms
* Thousands of VCs and Accelerators exist to pitch a Startup idea. Examples with OSS focus:
  * [OSS Capital](https://oss.capital/)
  * [AirTree](https://www.airtree.vc/open-source-vc) (Focus on Australia/New Zealand)
  * [Open Capital](https://opencapital.vc/) (Focus on Europe)
  * [RunaCap](https://runacap.com/ross-index/) ()

| One-time Income                   | Low    | Accelerators or incubators might only contribute little on-time
| Recurring Income                  | Medium | Probably a below-average salary but high potential when an exit occurs
| Income Stability / Predictability | Medium | Stable for a runway of ~18 month; New fundraising necessary
| Entry Threshold for client        | High   | Clarification of copyrights; Due dilligence on Team, Tech, etc.

| Additional Work                   | High   | Will require to build a pitch deck, business plan, website, etc.
| Upfront Cost                      | Low    | Might require small investment in domain name, trademark, etc.
| Continuous Cost                   | None   | After seed-round the invested money can be used from the startup
| Recipient                         | C      | The Startup will get the investment but founders (probably maintainers) get a salary
| Competitors                       | None   | If another group of maintainers would want to start a competing startup no VC would invest
