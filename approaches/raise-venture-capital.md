# Monetization via Raising Venture Capital
AKA: Founding Startup

Getting funding to build a startup / company from the OSS using venture capital. Often a very good business case is required but can result in a stable income for the next years (even if the startup is not successful).

Requires:
* Willingness to create a business / company (by all involved maintainers and maybe contributors)
* Setup of a business plan/idea
* Fund-raising

Variants & Options:
* Bootstrapped: Building a Startup without VC money - requires a already working business model
* VC Funding: Getting money to build the company makes buildup easier - but founders will loose full control

## Platforms

| --------------------------------- |:------ |:---- |
| Effort to set-up                  | Months | Basically, setup of a full business and fundraising
| Effort to maintain                | Medium | In the beginning fundraising every 18 months; Later hopefully break-even, IPO, etc.
| Cost to set-up                    | Low    | Might require small investment in domain name, trademark, etc.
| Cost to maintain                  | None   | After seed-round the invested money can be used from the startup
| One-time Income                   | Low    | Accelerators or incubators might only contribute little on-time
| Recurring Income                  | Medium | Probably a below-average salary but high potential when an exit occurs
| Income Predictability             | Medium | Stable for a runway of ~18 month; New fundraising necessary
| Full income Threshold             | 10+    | Probably several investors or angels necessary
| Recipient                         | C      | The Startup will get the investment but founders (probably maintainers) get a salary
| Additional Work                   | High   | Will require to build a pitch deck, business plan, website, etc.
| Visibility                        | High   | VCs get approached; Press will report

| Competitors                       | None   | If another group of maintainers would want to start a competing startup no VC would invest
| Software types                    | Special| Often stand-alone software with (potentially) many users (e.g., tools, databases, OS, LMS, etc.)
