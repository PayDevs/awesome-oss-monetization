# Monetization via Early Access
AKA: Sponsorware, Embargo model, "Unlock the commons"

Contributions made from private persons or companies to individual maintainers, contributors, or OSS projects in order to get early access to code, apis, documentation, etc. These are often semi-recurring payments for every new version.

Requires:
* Setup of a payment mechanism (hosted or self-build)
* Collection and description of one or more tiers / offerings

Variants & Options:
* Single payments for version- / result-specific early access
* Recurring payments for continuous access to "closed repository"
* Tiered Access Levels: Offering access to different maturity-levels or types (code, api, docu, ...)
* [Sponsorware](https://github.com/sponsorware/docs)
* [Embargo Model](https://lwn.net/Articles/786068/) as defined by Heather Meeker: sell access to code before it is publicly released (either to beta versions or even full final versions)
* ["Unlocking the commons"](https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/01/unlocking-the-commons/) as defined by Tim Carmondy: Giving access to early previews and experiments

## Platforms
* [Github Sponsors-only repositories](https://github.blog/2022-02-02-new-sponsors-only-repositories-custom-amounts-and-more/)
* [Memberspace](https://www.memberspace.com/) (giving access to (parts of) a website)
* [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) etc. (giving manual access to repos)

## Evaluation

| Characteristics                   | Value  | Note |
| --------------------------------- |:------ |:---- |
| Effort to set-up                  | Low    | Only requires private repository or password-protected website
| Effort to maintain income         | High   | Constant reminders to sponsor necessary; Requires additional "publish" step
| Visibility                        | Medium | Easy to forget, ignore, or overlook, but early-access users might talk about the new stuff
| Necessity to pay                  | Medium | Might be necessary for security-sensitive companies or hosting services (e.g., for databases)
| Scalability                       | Low    | Early access to OSS gives only rarely an edge
| One-time Income                   | Medium | Often based on hourly wage
| Recurring Income                  | Medium | Few users wants early access but might pay more and recurring if so
| Income Stability / Predictability | Medium | If recurring payments work they will probably continue  
| Entry Threshold for client        | Low    | Credit card is sufficient
| Clients needed for full income    | 100+   | based on 5k USD (pre-Tax)

| Effort for marketing              | Medium | Similar to donations but early-access users might talk about the new stuff
| Countervalue                      | Access | Might cause minimal additional work to handle multiple repositories
| Perfect for software type         | All    | Esp. for OSS that gives payer an edge (test security, write news, host service, ...)
