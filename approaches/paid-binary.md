# Monetization via Paid Binary
AKA: Selling without proprietary license

Payments for a official compiled binary version of the open-source software. While the OSS can have any license and freely used and shared by users, the official compiled binary has to be paid. These are often semi-recurring payments for every new version. Several projects with high amount of new versions even offer recurring monthly subscriptions.

Requires:
* Setup of a download mechanism (hosted or self-build)
* Setup of a payment mechanism

Variants & Options:
* Single payments for each major or minor version
* Recurring payments for continuous access to binaries
* App-store Hosting: Binary version of a mobile app in an App-store
* Cloud Hosted: Binary version or bundles deployable from a Cloud Marketplace

## Platforms
* [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) etc. (giving manual access to binaries)
* [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) (payment mechanism)
* [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/) (payment mechanism)
* [Paddle](https://www.paddle.com/) (self-build with international tax handling)

## Examples

| Characteristics                   | Value  | Note |
| --------------------------------- |:------ |:---- |
| Effort to set-up                  | Days   | Requires download and payment mechanism
| Effort to maintain                | Low    | Might require a feature roadmap that deploys new minor version every month
| Cost to set-up                    | Low    | Might require a little money for hosting binary version 
| Cost to maintain                  | Low    | Might require a little money for hosting binary version 
| One-time Income                   | Medium | Price can be freely set but orientates at prices for similar apps or tools
| Recurring Income                  | Medium | Few users want to or can compile binary by themselves 
| Income Predictability             | Medium | Depends on number of version deployed; If recurring payments work they will probably continue  
| Full income Threshold             | 100+   |

| Additional Work                   | Low    | Might require to manage downloadable binaries
| Visibility                        | High   | If binary is necessary every user will stumble upon payment
| Necessity to pay                  | Low    | Binary can be self-compiled or downloaded from third parties
| Entry Threshold                   | Low    | Credit card is sufficient
