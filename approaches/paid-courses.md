# Monetization via Paid Online Courses
AKA: Paid Online Trainings

Payments from individuals for an online course about the open-source software from the maintainer(s).
Often one-time payments for one course, but ad revenue from video platforms such as youtube etc. is an alternative.

Requires:
* Setup of a payment mechanism (hosted or self-build)
* Design and description of online course content
* Filming of online course incl. demonstration code

Variants & Options:
* Full Course Video: Maintainers create (multi-hour) courses once to teach the use of the software.
* Short Todo Videos: Maintainers create many short videos about one topic and converts via ads
* Tutorials: Extensive written content with examples in an readable form (not just the documentation)
