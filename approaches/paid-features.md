# Monetization via Paid Features
AKA: Bounty driven Development

Payment offers made by companies or individuals to develop new features, functionalities, interfaces, etc. important to their business-case.
Often these are one-time payment offers for one feature, but hundred of users have thousands of feature requests.

Requires:
* Setup of a payment mechanism (hosted or self-build)
* Collection and description of one or more feature with time

Variants & Options:
* Single Feature: Development of one request
* Bulk Features: Implementation of multiple features (border on freelance contracting)
* Auctioned Feature development: Highest bidder gets to choose the feature to implement next
* Custom Features: Development of features that only the buyer gets

> NOTE: If external contributors develop features and maintainers accept the changes the bounties are paid to the contributors and not the the maintainers of the project. This might be hindering the monetization effort of the OSS project by the maintainers.
