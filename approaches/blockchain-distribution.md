# Monetization via Blockchain Distibution

Contributions made by a user to the OSS project by downloading it with a blockchain-based package manager. Will lead to recurring payments - currently in form of crypto tokens that need to be converted into real money.

Requires:
* Package manager that is able to register and distribute OSS (e.g., a MacOS application)
* Might require additional mechanism to convert crypto tokens into money

Variants & Options:
* Download-based: Tokens are distributed based on downloads
* Sponsor-based: Tokens can be bought by users and gifted (or used to "pay" for downloads)

## Platforms
* [tea.xyz](https://tea.xyz/) (Blockchain-based package manager)

## Evaluation

| Characteristics                   | Value  | Note |
| --------------------------------- |:------ |:---- |
| Effort to set-up                  | Low    | Registering at the blockchain-based package manager
| Effort to maintain income         | Low    | Probably only uploading or registering new versions
| Visibility                        | Medium | Might be visible if users need to buy tokens to download
| Necessity to pay                  | High   | Payment is enforced by using the package manager
| Scalability                       | High   | Scales with the number of users
| One-time Income                   | N/A    | Token system probably causes recurring revenue
| Recurring Income                  | Low    | Crypto might not be worth much; Depends on need to buy tokens
| Income Stability / Predictability | Medium | If users accept paying it should become stable; Crypto might be very volatile
| Entry Threshold for client        | None   | Client only pays indirectly via his hoster/cloud for the resources
| Clients needed for full income    | ?1000+ | Depends heavily on pricing of the crypto token

| Effort for marketing              | None   | Will make waves but no "sale" is necessary
| Countervalue                      | OSS    | User pays for downloading & using the OSS
| Perfect for software type         | Special| Best for tools and libraries
