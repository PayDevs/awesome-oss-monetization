# Monetization via Paid Commercial Use
AKA: Dual-Licensing, Multi-Licensing, Resticted License, Proprietary Licences, License Exceptions

Different licenses forcing commercial users to pay a license fee to the open source project. Enables recurring payments often with support guarantees or SLAs.

Requires:
* Setup of a payment mechanism (hosted or self-build)
* Setup of a license for commercial-use
* Probably a legal entity needs to be founded to receive the payments
* Recurring "observation activites" to check if the OSS is in use by companies not paying

Variants & Options:
* Dual License: Single license for entities with a commercial use of the OSS
* Multi License: Different licenses for startups, freelancer, companies, universities, etc. 

## Platforms
* None required?: Only one codebase and commercial users directly pay to OSS project's bank account

| Characteristics                   | Value  | Note |
| --------------------------------- |:------ |:---- |
| Effort to set-up                  | High   | Creation of a commercial license and legal documents
| Effort to maintain income         | Low    | Maybe reminders that commercial use is needed
| Visibility                        | Medium | Easy to overlook but should stand out in a tech due dilligence
| Necessity to pay                  | High   | However, companies might look for other solutions
| Scalability                       | Medium | Scales with the number of commercial users (who must pay)
| One-time Income                   | High   | Few companies might pay large amounts if the OSS is essential
| Recurring Income                  | High   | License can enforce recurring payments per month or year
| Income Stability / Predictability | High   | Companies probably need OSS for several years
| Entry Threshold for client        | Medium | Individual contracts between every OSS and company might be necessary
| Clients needed for full income    | 10+    | based on 5k USD (pre-Tax)

| Effort for marketing              | Low    | 
| Countervalue                      | None   | Legal commercial use
| Perfect for software type         | Special| Best for libraries or programs companies build tools upon

| Additional Work                   | Medium | Will cause communication and SLA related work
| Upfront Cost                      | Medium | Will require a lawyer to setup the license and contracts
| Continuous Cost                   | Low    | Will cause costs for legal or tax related stuff (but should be covered by income)

| Competitors                       | O      | Depends on the original OSS licence: other companies could fork and develop it further with a proprietary license.
