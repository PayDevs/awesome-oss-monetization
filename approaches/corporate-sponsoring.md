# Monetization via Corporate Sonsoring

Voluntary contributions made from companies to individual maintainers, contributors, or OSS projects. Often these are one-time sponsorings, but recurring payments in form of quasi-salaries are becoming more common.

Requires:
* Setup of a company-grade payment mechanism (hosted or self-build)
* Description of one or more donation tiers
* Recurring "marketing activites" to motivate companies to sponsor
* Recurring communication with sponsors

Variants & Options:
* Single Sponsoring: One-time contribution
* Recurring Sponsoring: Monthly recurring contributions
* Tiered Sponsoring Levels: Offering of mentions (on Twitter, etc.), talks, seminars, etc. for higher or recurring donations

## Platforms
* [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/)

## Evaluation

| Characteristics                   | Value  | Note |
| --------------------------------- |:------ |:---- |
| Effort to set-up                  | Medium | Companies might need more documentation than for donations
| Effort to maintain                | Medium | Companies are more likely to inject new money
| Cost to set-up                    | None   | 
| Cost to maintain                  | None   | 
| One-time Income                   | Medium | Few sponsors will pay more than a yearly salary (due to fund size and high competition (too many projects to feed))
| Recurring Income                  | Medium | Few sponsors will pay recurring salary-like sponsorings (probably capped with yearly fund)
| Income Predictability             | Medium | Monthly to yearly reminders to sponsor necessary; Sponsors are more loyal but if one big sponsor goes it causes higher instability
| Full income Threshold             | 10+    | 
| Recipient                         | C      |

| Visibility                        | Low    | Better for essential but underfunded OSS with problems
| Necessity to pay                  | Low    | Completely voluntary; Better for essential OSS
| Entry Threshold                   | Medium | Requires charitable entity or company-level consideration of taxes, etc.
| Countervalue                      | Work   | Can range from unrestricted use of money to development of specific features 
| Scalability                       | Low    | Scales with the number of companies (but probably capped at salary level)
| Effort for marketing              | Medium | Companies often seek out OSS on their own (essential to their products)
| Competitors                       | None   | 
| Software types                    | All    |
