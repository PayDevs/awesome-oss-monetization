| Visibility                        | Medium | Easy to forget, ignore, or overlook, but certified people might talk about it

| Software types                    | Big SW | Better for big, complex and widely-used software

> NOTE: Potentially, "unofficial" certificate can also be issued by non-maintainers (i.e., just expert), which could increase the competition (or income by "licencing" the right to certify).
