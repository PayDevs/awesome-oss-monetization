* Description of one or more donation tiers
* Recurring "marketing activites" to motivate users to donate

Variants & Options:
* Single Donation: One-time contribution
* Recurring Donation: Monthly recurring contributions
* Tiered Donation Levels: Offering of mentions (on Twitter, etc.), swag, chats, meetups, etc. for higher or recurring donations
