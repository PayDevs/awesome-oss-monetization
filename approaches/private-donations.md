# Monetization via Private Donations
AKA: Donationware

Voluntary contributions made from private persons to individual maintainers, contributors, or OSS projects. Often these are one-time donations, but recurring payments are also becoming more common.

Requires:
* Setup of a payment mechanism (hosted or self-build)
* Description of one or more donation tiers
* Recurring "marketing activites" to motivate users to donate

Variants & Options:
* Single Donation: One-time contribution
* Recurring Donation: Monthly recurring contributions
* Tiered Donation Levels: Offering of mentions (on Twitter, etc.), swag, chats, meetups, etc. for higher or recurring donations
