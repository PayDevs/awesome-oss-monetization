# Monetization via Paid Support
AKA: Paid Maintenance, Paid Quality Assurances

Payments by companies to check security issues in their OSS supply chain, ensure specific SLAs, or ensure quick fixes for business-threatening problems in the OSS. Sometimes hidden behind a third-party company (middleman) that handles the bureaucracy, quasi-employs the maintainer, and pays him money.

Requires:
* Application to be "hired" by a middleman or setup of contracts with SLAs
* Time to work on problems asap (as defined in SLAs)
* Optionally, setup of private issue tracker, communication platform(s), etc. to interact with companies

Variants & Options:
* Direct contracts: Multiple companies pay maintainer/project directly
* Contracts via Middleman: Companies make contract with Middleman and Middleman with maintainers

## Evaluation

| Characteristics                   | Value  | Note |
| --------------------------------- |:------ |:---- |
| Effort to set-up                  | Medium | Contracts require more time to define (one-time) and negotiate (per company)
| Effort to maintain                | Low    | If companies or middleman is still interested only maintenance work is required
| Cost to set-up                    | None   | 
| Cost to maintain                  | None   | 
| One-time Income                   | Low    | Recurring is more common - one-time payments for emergencies maybe
| Recurring Income                  | Medium | Middleman typically caps at salary level. Direct contracts are similar to building a startup/company to meet SLAs
| Income Predictability             | High   | Companies or Middleman will pay for a longer time. If Middleman breaks away whole income might vanish. If multiple contracts exist one cancelling company will not endanger full income.
| Full income Threshold             | 1 | 10+| One middleman or several companies; 
| Recipient                         | I      | 
| Additional Work                   | High   | Extra work to fix bugs, develop feature, etc. - might be covered by "standby" time
| Visibility                        | None   | Companies or middleman seek out and select OSS projects
| Necessity to pay                  | Medium | Might be necessary for companies using important projects that are essential to the business-model 
| Entry Threshold                   | Medium | Companies need contracts with many OSS projects or one Middleman
| Countervalue                      | Work   | Middleman will probably pay quasi-salary or by the hour; Direct contracts can enable selling the service multiple times
| Scalability                       | Medium | Contracts with multiple companies possible. Middleman probably limits at one salary.
| Effort for marketing              | Low    | Middleman will do marketing; Direct contracts might need more
| Competitors                       | None   | Other maintainers might be integrated
| Software types                    | All    | Esp. essential software that is essential to the business-model of companies
